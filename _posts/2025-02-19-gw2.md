## GW2 Linux issues

Over the past few months I've gotten addicted to Guild Wars 2 (also known as GW2).

GW2 is a hidden gem amongst MMOs these days for some reason.  It's pretty easy to set it up on Linux and play it via steam, ignoring the occasional oddity that happens when you play around with settings a bit much.

Which is why I'm writing this post to help fellow GW2 players: if you've experienced frame skips, rubber banding, or freezes while playing the game, you're not alone.  I have experienced that quite a bit lately.

For a while I thought it was a separate issue with how my laptop is setup -- it's not the average laptop, I don't think; it's decently equipped.  I won't be specific here as it is not the point of this post, however I was wrong.

The fix is just to enable "Steam overlay" in game settings, right click the game's name in your game list and find the settings from there.  It seems like there's some extra stuff bundled in with the Steam overlay function which if turned off, causes all sorts of issues with GW2 for some odd reason.

It's frustrating as I don't like the steam overlay, but there you go -- it's the fix.  Hope this saved you a few hours of troubleshooting!
